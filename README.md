# kotlin-lotto

## Project Overview

This is a **Kotlin** project for building a simple lottery ticket machine.  
The application allows users to purchase lotto tickets, enter winning numbers (6 digits separated by comma) and a bonus number, generate the appropriate number of Lotto tickets and check winning results.

To complete this project, I have used **TDD** and **Pair Programming**.

I’m still quite new to both TDD and pair programming, but I’d say they were really valuable experiences for me.

With Test-Driven Development, it was honestly a bit hard at first. Writing the tests before writing the actual logic felt unnatural and slower than I expected. But as I kept going, I realized it gave me a much clearer direction and helped me avoid overcomplicating my code. It made me think more precisely about what the code should do before jumping into implementation, which I found really helpful.

Pair programming was also something I hadn’t really done in this way before, especially sharing a single laptop and constantly switching roles. At first, it was a bit intimidating, but I quickly saw how useful it was. It pushed me to explain my thought process clearly and think critically about decisions in real-time. I also learned a lot just by watching how my pair approached problems differently.

Overall, both practices challenged me, but in a very positive way. I feel like I grew a lot from them and want to keep improving in both areas.

## Features

- Accepts user input for purchase amount.
- Accepts user input for how many tickets to buy manually.
- Accepts user input for each manual ticket (comma-separated, 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45).
- The rest of the tickets are generated automatically by the system.
- Each ticket costs **1,000 KRW** and contains **6 unique random numbers** between **1** and **45**.
- Display the total number of tickets purchased (both manually and automatically generated).
- Display all purchased tickets (both manually and automatically generated and sorted).
- Display each ticket in a new line.
- Accepts **winning numbers** (comma-separated, 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45) and a **bonus number** (must be different from the winning numbers) from the user.
- Matches purchased tickets against the winning numbers and determines the winning rank:
  - 1st Prize: 6 matches — **2,000,000,000 KRW**
  - 2nd Prize: 5 matches + bonus — **30,000,000 KRW**
  - 3rd Prize: 5 matches — **1,500,000 KRW**
  - 4th Prize: 4 matches — **50,000 KRW**
  - 5th Prize: 3 matches — **5,000 KRW**
- Displays lotto result statistics (number of winning tickets per rank).
- Calculates and displays the **return rate** (rounded to two decimal places).
- Handles invalid input and throw on IllegalArgumentException with specific error messages.

## Programming Requirements

- All features must be implemented using **TDD**, and each must have corresponding unit tests (excluding UI logic).
- Separate core logic from UI logic.
- Use of dedicated classes such as InputView and ResultView for UI-related code. 
- Limit indentation depth to 1 (must not exceed 2). 
- Keep each function/method under 10 lines. 
- Ensure each function does only one thing. 
- Use an Enum class to model the prize ranks. 
- Use a **First-Class Collection** to encapsulate collections meaningfully.

---

## Testing

- All business logic is unit tested with **JUnit 5** and **AssertJ**.
- Exception handling tests ensure invalid inputs are properly managed.
